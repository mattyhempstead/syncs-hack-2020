# QR Tones

QR Tones is an app that encodes text to audio wave-forms, similar to QR Codes but for sound. When text is provided, the app will convert it into a tune that encodes the data that is to be transmitted. Any other device listening will be able to decode the data and receive the text that is being transmitted.

The webapp was built using React.js. We used the web audio API to get user microphone input. A custom protocol and algorithm based on Fourier analysis was developed to both encode and decode the text into their respective QR Tones.
